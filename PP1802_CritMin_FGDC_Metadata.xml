      <abstract>The point and polygon layers within this geodatabase present the global distribution of selected mineral resource features (deposits, mines, districts, mineral regions) for 22 minerals or mineral commodities considered critical to the
economy and security of the United States as of 2017. These data complement the report by Schulz and others (2017) which provides national and global information on 23 critical minerals - antimony (Sb), barite (barium, Ba), beryllium (Be), cobalt
(Co), fluorite or fluorspar (fluorine, F), gallium (Ga), germanium (Ge), graphite (carbon, C), hafnium (Hf), indium (In), lithium (Li), manganese (Mn), niobium (Nb), platinum-group elements (PGE), rare-earth elements (REE), rhenium (Re), selenium
(Se), tantalum (Ta), tellurium (Te), tin (Sn), titanium (Ti), vanadium (V), and zirconium (Zr) resources. The geospatial locations for deposits containing selenium, which is recovered mainly as a byproduct of other produced mineral commodities, is
not included in this geodatabase. These geospatial data and the accompanying report are an update to information published in 1973 in U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 820, United States Mineral Resources. For the current and full discussion
of the individual critical minerals, their uses, identified resources, national and global distribution, geologic overview, resource assessment, and geoenvironmental considerations see: Schulz, K.J., DeYoung, J.H., Jr., Seal, R.R., II, and Bradley,
D.C., eds., 2017, Critical mineral resources of the United States—Economic and environmental geology and prospects for future supply: U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 1802, 777 p., https://doi.org/10.3133/pp1802</abstract>
      <purpose>The data represent the global distribution of selected critical mineral resources in mines, deposits, districts, and regions as of 2017. The geospatial data provide generalized information such as feature name, deposit type, and location
description. The data are used in the analysis of current and future supply chains of mineral commodities important to the U.S. economy and security and the environmental consequences related to their production and use. The point and polygon vector
data in the geodatabase are suitable for use in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) or other database and geospatial software. The data may be used to develop maps, perform regional-scale geospatial analyses, or assess mineral resources in the areas
covered by the data. The information is intended to meet the needs of a wide community of users that includes the geoscience and mineral exploration communities as well as State and Federal agencies, Congress, private industry, and the general
public.</purpose>
      <supplinf>The locations of critical mineral resource features, for example, mines or deposits, are most commonly reported as latitude and longitude coordinates or shown as points in source maps and reports. Occasionally these features are described
or shown as areas. For this reason, most critical mineral locations are provided in a point feature class in the corresponding ArcGIS 10.0 file geodatabase, and a few are provided as areal outlines in the polygon feature class. Not all deposit
locations are discussed in the accompanying report. The ArcGIS feature classes are also provided as Esri shapefiles. Attribute field names in the shapefiles are limited to 10-characters; therefore, truncated shapefile field names are provided in
brackets in the “Attribute Label” description where applicable (for example, Deposit_Type [Deposit_Ty]).</supplinf>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Geospatial locations for critical mineral deposits, districts, belts, etc. were compiled from a variety of sources including published reports, tables, maps, web sources, databases (for example, the USGS Mineral Resources Data System), and
imagery. Some locations were confirmed using available imagery in applications such as Google Earth. However, many locations may be one to tens of kilometers from their actual locations. Most location information was summarized in Chapters C-V of the
accompanying report (PP 1802 (2017)) along with descriptions of commodity uses, production and resources, geology, and geoenvironmental considerations. Using these and other summaries, data were spatially integrated using ArcGIS for all mineral
commodities except selenium (Chapter Q), which is recovered mainly as a byproduct of other mineral commodities. Attribute information such as deposit name, deposit type, mineral or elemental commodity or elemental group (for example, PGE or REE), and
country were added to the point and polygon feature classes. Data inspection and checks were performed throughout the compilation and reviews were performed to assess the accuracy and completeness of feature capture and attribution relative to the
accompanying report. Data compilation was completed in 2017.</procdesc>
